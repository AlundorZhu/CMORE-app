Insead of letting the [frameProcessor](./CMORE/FrameProcessing/FrameProcessor.swift) create the asyncStream for incoming frame based on the the counting blocks bool. Let [viewModel/CameraManager](./CMORE/CMOREViewModel.swift) create the asyncStream for video stream when the camera opens. So I can use the built in buffer strategy of buffering the newest 6 frames. Also the code in the frameProcessor `startCountingBlocks` function will be cleaner. That it will only need to create one asyncStream for reordering frames instead of two. Also the handle for printing dropped frames and fps will be reported by the frameProcessor.
